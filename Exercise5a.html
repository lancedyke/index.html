<h1 align="center">IT Job Wages Are No Longer 'Exceptional'</h1>
<h2>Wage growth in IT jobs has moderated following the dot-com boom, according to new research by Ruiqing Sam Cao and Shane Greenstein.</h2>
<pre style="font-size: 16px;">
    Over the past few decades, information technology jobs worked their way into the popular 
    imagination as among the most stable, fast-rising, and lucrative ways to make a living, 
    bolstered in the 1990s by the dot-com boom. What astronauts were in the 1960s, rock 
    star programmers were early this century.

    The reality, it turns out, is a bit different when it comes to IT wages, according to new 
    research. In all but the largest cities, wage growth in IT jobs has become relatively 
    moderate following the dot-com boom, coming to resemble wage patterns seen in the 
    broader STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) labor market trends. 
    And in geographic regions where competition is fiercest for IT talent, superstar 
    performers do not earn the same high premium they once did over their average-performing peers.
  
    In short, IT wages, while still high relative to many other occupations, have lost their 
    “exceptional” luster. IT wage premiums today have more to do with where a job is 
    practiced than with rewarding specific skills.

    “While it is a popular hypothesis that returns to IT skills are exceptionally high in the
    recent decade, which might lead us to imagine that IT wage premium should at least 
    partially explain rising wage inequality in the United States—a widely documented fact—
    we find evidence to the contrary,” the authors write.

    The paper, Digital Labor Market Inequality and the Decline of IT Exceptionalism, was 
    written by Harvard Business School's Ruiqing Sam Cao, a post-doctoral researcher, and 
    Shane Greenstein, the Martin Marshall Professor of Business Administration.

<h2>The dawn of digital careers</h2>
<pre style="font-size: 16px;">
    Beginning with the invention of the personal computer in the 1980s, IT wages 
    commanded a premium over other STEM salaries. This trend continued with the expansion 
    of the internet, especially in high-tech clusters—geographic regions where skilled worker 
    wages increased faster than in the rest of the country.

    To chart the rise and fall of IT salaries, the researchers examined 142 of the largest urban 
    areas in the US between 2000 and 2018, a time of rapid change in IT including two 
    economic recessions. Smaller cities and rural areas were excluded because of missing 
    data for at least one year during this time period.

    Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Greenstein and Cao parsed both the broad 
    difference in IT wages for the lowest paying jobs in the profession as a whole (computer 
    support specialists) and the highest (computer research scientists), comparing them with 
    patterns in other STEM professions like chemist. 

    While salaries in five places—Silicon Valley, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington DC and 
    New York—climbed amid competition for talent, IT workers in the rest of the country 
    didn’t get the same bump, according to the research.

    “We thought we could look at the same thing in different places—how it changed over 
    time—and compare those changes to see whether the regional inequality that showed up 
    was due to IT,” says Greenstein, who also co-chairs Harvard Business School’s Digital Initiative.
